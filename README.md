# Graph and Algorithms Project

This project implements a basic `Graph` class and various algorithms to operate on graphs, including:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traverses the graph level by level from a starting vertex.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traverses the graph as deep as possible from a starting vertex before backtracking.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices.
- **Prim's Algorithm**: Constructs a minimum spanning tree using Prim's method.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Constructs a minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's method.

The project includes:
- `Graph.cpp` and `Graph.h`: Implementation of the `Graph` class.
- `Algorithms.cpp` and `Algorithms.h`: Implementation of the algorithms operating on graphs.
- `Main.cpp`: Example usage and demonstrations of the implemented features.
- `Test.cpp`: Automated unit tests using the **doctest** framework.
